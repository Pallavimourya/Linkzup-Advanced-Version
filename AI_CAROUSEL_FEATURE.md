# AI Carousel Generation Feature

## Overview
The AI Carousel feature allows users to automatically generate professional carousel content using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. Users can specify a topic, tone, and number of slides, and the AI will generate appropriate content for each slide.

## How It Works

### 1. User Input
- **Topic**: The main subject of the carousel (e.g., "LinkedIn Marketing Tips", "Remote Work Best Practices")
- **Tone**: The style of content (Professional, Casual, Inspirational, etc.)
- **Number of Slides**: Between 3-10 slides
- **Style**: Design preferences

### 2. AI Generation Process
1. User submits the form with their preferences
2. The system calls the OpenAI API via `/api/ai/generate-carousel`
3. AI generates content based on the specified parameters
4. Content is parsed and structured into individual slides
5. Each slide is formatted with appropriate text lengths:
   - Headings: 3-4 words maximum
   - Bullet points: 8-12 words maximum
   - Content is optimized for card display

### 3. Slide Structure
- **Slide 1**: Title slide with topic and main message
- **Slides 2-N-1**: Key points with bullet lists (3 bullets per slide)
- **Slide N**: Call-to-action slide

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoint
- **Route**: `/api/ai/generate-carousel`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Required (user session)
- **Input**: `{ topic, tone, slideCount, style }`
- **Output**: AI-generated content with proper structure

### Content Parsing
The system includes intelligent parsing that:
- Extracts relevant content from AI responses
- Ensures proper slide structure
- Handles edge cases and content validation
- Provides fallback content when needed

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages
- Retry mechanism for failed generations
- Content validation and structure adjustment
- User-friendly error notifications

## User Experience Features

### Form Validation
- Topic length limit (100 characters)
- Real-time character count
- Required field validation
- Preview of what will be generated

### Loading States
- Spinner during generation
- Progress indication
- Disabled states during processing

### Retry Mechanism
- Automatic retry button after failed attempts
- Attempt counter tracking
- Improved error messages

## Content Guidelines

### AI Prompts
The system uses optimized prompts that ensure:
- Concise, impactful content
- Professional tone matching
- Appropriate content length for slides
- Consistent structure across slides

### Content Optimization
- Short, memorable headings
- Actionable bullet points
- Engaging call-to-action
- Professional language appropriate for LinkedIn

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to the AI Carousel tab in the dashboard
2. Enter your topic (keep it concise)
3. Select your preferred tone
4. Choose the number of slides (3-10)
5. Click "Generate AI Carousel"
6. Wait for AI processing (usually 10-30 seconds)
7. Review and edit the generated content as needed
8. Customize design elements (fonts, colors, backgrounds)
9. Export or post to LinkedIn

## Best Practices

### For Better AI Generation
- Use specific, focused topics
- Keep topic descriptions under 100 characters
- Choose appropriate tone for your audience
- Consider your target slide count

### Content Editing
- Review AI-generated content for accuracy
- Adjust text length if needed for better fit
- Customize design elements for brand consistency
- Test different slide layouts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Content too short**: Try a more specific topic
- **Generation fails**: Check your internet connection and try again
- **Content doesn't fit**: Use the editing tools to adjust text length
- **Wrong tone**: Regenerate with different tone selection

### Support
If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your account has sufficient credits
3. Try with a different topic or tone
4. Contact support if problems persist
