# Personal Story Integration System

## Overview

The Personal Story Integration System allows users to save their personal story answers to the database and use them as a reference for generating personalized content across all AI-powered features in the application.

## How It Works

### 1. Personal Story Data Collection

Users fill out a comprehensive personal story questionnaire with the following questions:
- **Biggest Professional Challenge**: Describe a significant challenge faced in career
- **Proudest Achievement**: Share an accomplishment that's particularly meaningful
- **Learning from Failure**: Tell about a time when things didn't go as planned
- **Influential Mentor or Role Model**: Describe someone who significantly impacted professional journey
- **Career Turning Point**: Share a moment or decision that changed career direction
- **Key Life/Career Lesson**: What's the most important lesson learned professionally

### 2. Data Storage

Personal story data is stored in the `personalStoryAnswers` collection in MongoDB with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userEmail: String,
  answers: {
    challenge: String,
    achievement: String,
    failure: String,
    mentor: String,
    turning_point: String,
    lesson: String
  },
  customization: {
    tone: String,
    language: String,
    targetAudience: String,
    mainGoal: String,
    storyLength: String,
    emotionalTone: String,
    includeCallToAction: Boolean,
    includeHashtags: Boolean,
    includeEmojis: Boolean,
    personalTouch: Boolean
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 3. Content Generation Integration

When generating content, the system:

1. **Checks for Personal Story**: Retrieves user's personal story data from database
2. **Builds Context**: Creates a comprehensive context string from the story data
3. **Enhances Prompts**: Injects personal story context into AI prompts
4. **Generates Personalized Content**: AI uses the story as reference for authentic, personalized content

### 4. Fallback Behavior

If no personal story is available:
- System uses general best practices and industry insights
- Content is generated without personal references
- Maintains high quality but lacks personalization

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. PersonalStoryService (`lib/personal-story-service.ts`)

**Key Methods:**
- `getUserStoryData(userEmail)`: Fetches personal story data for a user
- `hasUserCompletedStory(userEmail)`: Checks if user has completed their story
- `buildStoryContext(storyData)`: Builds context string for AI prompts
- `buildFallbackContext()`: Provides fallback context when no story exists
- `extractStoryThemes(storyData)`: Extracts key themes from story
- `getPersonalizedSuggestions(storyData)`: Generates content suggestions based on story

#### 2. Enhanced AI Service (`lib/ai-service.ts`)

**Key Changes:**
- Added `userEmail` parameter to `AIRequest` interface
- Modified `buildPrompt()` to be async and include personal story context
- Updated all content type prompts to include personal story context
- Enhanced `generateContent()` method to accept user email

#### 3. Updated API Endpoints

All content generation endpoints now include personal story integration:

- `/api/ai/generate` - Main AI generation endpoint
- `/api/ai/generate-carousel` - Carousel content generation
- `/api/ai/generate-content` - General content generation
- `/api/ai/generate-linkedin-posts` - LinkedIn post generation
- `/api/ai/generate-topics` - Topic generation

### Content Types Supported

All content types now use personal story context:

1. **LinkedIn Posts** - Personalized professional posts
2. **Articles** - Comprehensive articles with personal insights
3. **Topics** - Viral-worthy topic titles based on user's experiences
4. **Carousel** - Visual content with personal touch
5. **Stories** - Personal, relatable stories
6. **Lists** - Numbered list content with personal examples
7. **Quotes** - Inspirational quote posts with personal context
8. **Before-After** - Transformation content using personal experiences
9. **Tips** - Actionable tips with personal examples
10. **Insights** - Deep analysis content with personal perspective
11. **Questions** - Discussion-starting questions based on user's journey

## Usage Examples

### 1. Saving Personal Story

```typescript
// Frontend: Save personal story answers
const response = await fetch('/api/personal-story/answers', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    answers: {
      challenge: "Faced a major project deadline crisis...",
      achievement: "Successfully led a cross-functional team...",
      // ... other answers
    },
    customization: {
      tone: "professional",
      targetAudience: "LinkedIn professionals",
      // ... other preferences
    }
  })
})
```

### 2. Generating Personalized Content

```typescript
// Frontend: Generate content with personal story integration
const response = await fetch('/api/ai/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    type: "linkedin-post",
    prompt: "leadership challenges",
    provider: "openai",
    customization: {
      tone: "professional",
      targetAudience: "LinkedIn professionals",
      mainGoal: "engagement"
    }
  })
})
```

### 3. Backend: AI Service Usage

```typescript
// Backend: Generate content with personal story
const response = await aiService.generateContent(
  "linkedin-post",
  "leadership challenges",
  "openai",
  {
    tone: "professional",
    targetAudience: "LinkedIn professionals",
    mainGoal: "engagement"
  },
  session.user.id,
  session.user.email // This triggers personal story integration
)
```

## Personal Story Context Example

When a user has completed their personal story, the AI receives context like this:

```
PERSONAL STORY CONTEXT:
Use the following personal experiences and insights to create authentic, personalized content:

Professional Challenge: I faced a major project deadline crisis when our lead developer left unexpectedly, leaving our team without critical knowledge of the system architecture.

Proudest Achievement: Successfully led a cross-functional team of 12 people to deliver a complex software project 2 weeks ahead of schedule, resulting in a 30% increase in customer satisfaction.

Learning from Failure: Early in my career, I made a poor hiring decision that cost the company $50,000 and delayed our product launch by 3 months. This taught me the importance of thorough vetting and cultural fit.

Influential Mentor/Role Model: My former manager Sarah taught me that leadership isn't about being the smartest person in the room, but about empowering others to be their best selves and creating an environment where everyone can thrive.

Career Turning Point: Switching from a technical role to management was scary, but it opened up opportunities to impact more people and drive organizational change. It completely changed how I view my career and purpose.

Key Life/Career Lesson: The most important lesson I've learned is that vulnerability and authenticity in leadership create stronger teams. When I started sharing my own struggles and mistakes, my team became more open and collaborative.
