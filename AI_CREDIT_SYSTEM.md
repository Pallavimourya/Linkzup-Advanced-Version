## ðŸ”„ Credit Deduction Flow

### 1. Pre-Generation Check
- Credits are checked and deducted **before** AI processing begins
- If insufficient credits, request is rejected with clear error message
- Trial users can generate content with their trial credits

### 2. Credit Deduction Process
```javascript
// Credit deduction happens in /api/ai/generate
const requiredCredits = getRequiredCredits(type, provider)
const actionType = `ai_${type}`

// Deduct credits before generation
await fetch('/api/credits/deduct', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    actionType,
    description: `AI ${type} generation using ${provider}`,
    credits: requiredCredits
  })
})
```

### 3. Transaction Recording
- All AI generation transactions are recorded in `credit_transactions` collection
- Includes action type, credits deducted, description, and timestamp
- Used for analytics and user history
