# LinkedIn OAuth & AI Carousel Fixes

## ðŸš¨ LinkedIn OAuth Redirect URI Issue

### Problem
The error "The redirect_uri does not match the registered value" occurs when signing in with LinkedIn. This happens because the redirect URI being sent to LinkedIn doesn't match what's registered in the LinkedIn app.

### Root Cause
- The LinkedIn app is configured with a different redirect URI than what the application is sending
- Environment variables may not be properly configured
- The callback URL construction logic may be using incorrect base URLs

### Solution

#### 1. Update LinkedIn App Configuration
1. Go to [LinkedIn Developers Console](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/)
2. Select your app
3. Go to "Auth" tab
4. Add this exact redirect URI: `https://www.linkzup.in/api/linkedin/callback`
5. Save changes

#### 2. Environment Variables
Set these in your Vercel environment variables:
\`\`\`bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://www.linkzup.in
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI=https://www.linkzup.in/api/linkedin/callback
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
\`\`\`

#### 3. Code Updates Made
- Updated `app/api/test-linkedin-config/route.ts` with better error reporting
- Enhanced `app/api/linkedin/connect/route.ts` to use correct redirect URIs
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting information

### Testing
Run the fix script:
\`\`\`bash
./fix-linkedin-redirect.sh
\`\`\`

Or test the configuration:
\`\`\`bash
curl https://www.linkzup.in/api/test-linkedin-config
\`\`\`
